/**
 * This is a Java record class called {@code UserDTO} that represents a data transfer object for a user. It has six fields:
 * {@code name}, {@code birthDate}, {@code gender}, {@code cpf}, {@code email}, and {@code relation}. Each field has validation annotations that specify
 * constraints on the data that can be stored in the field. For example, the {@code name} field must not be blank, must be
 * between 2 and 150 characters in length, and must contain only letters. The {@code cpf} field must not be blank, must be
 * exactly 11 characters in length, and must be a valid Brazilian CPF number. The {@code relation} field is annotated with
 * {@code @Valid}, which means that any nested objects of type {@code UserRelationDTO} will also be validated. This record class is
 * used to transfer user data between different parts of an application or between different applications.
